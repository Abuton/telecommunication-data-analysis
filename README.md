**Analysis was done to answer some very important Business questions with beautiful plots and detailed explanation**

An investor is interested in purchasing TellCo, an existing mobile service provider in the Republic of Pefkakia. TellCo’s current owners have been willing to share their financial information but have never employed anyone to look at their data that is generated automatically by their systems. Your employer wants you to provide a report to analyze opportunities for growth and make a recommendation on whether TellCo is worth buying or selling. You will do this by analyzing a telecommunication dataset that contains useful information about the customers & their activities on the network.
